## Project Description
In this project seeks to explore whhich start-ups receive the much funding in India

Overview
Start-ups are usually newly established companies or organizations in their early stages of development. Therefore, they are usually associated with many uncertainties and risks for their limited resources. Hence, they require significant funding and support to get off the ground. Investors provide start-ups and other ventures with the capital, popularly known as funding, to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. However, not all start-ups can thrive and flourish even after the funding. This has resulted in the question of what is necessary for a start-up to flourish. A common cliche is that Ideas, creativity, and execution are necessary for a start-up to flourish, but are they enough?

Introduction
In recent years, India has become a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship due to their pool of skilled entrepreneurs and a supportive government. However, that doesnt necessarily mean that every start-up in the Indian ecosystem,flourishes.Therefore, it is necessary for a start-up to look into the investors, funding, and the factors that separate the start_ups that flourishes, and those that fail after the funding. This project will analyze the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021, which includes start-ups' details, funding details, funding amount, and investors' information. The mode of inquiry adapted for this project involved posing questions, examining the dataset for each year, and performing exploratory data analysis(EDA) to identify the trends and patterns in the funding data. By doing so, we hope to provide insights to our team on the best course of action when venturing in the Indian start-up ecosystem.
